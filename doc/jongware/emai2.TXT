Hi Alexander!

Hey, that's great! You've done some fantastic things so far! Milky way looks
great, so does the text. And it must be a miracle it is actually playable as
well :)
Now I can see where you have problems (and how they relate to your
questions), I'll take a closer look to them.
With this latest build of my mesh viewer you can see where I'm still in the
dark! A few keys: P for points, K for kolor, S for Solids (not depth sorted
or textured...). Rotate with arrows or mouse, zoom in and out with numeric +
and -. Type a number or use page up/down for other models; L to toggle
Landing state (on ships and stations). R for 'random' parameters on ships
and most cities.
Oh, and you can change the vertical size of the window but it crashes when
you change the width... (bah!).

A few short answers I can quickly find in my source:

SCALEDSUBOBJECT:
obj1B ORIENTATION|VERTEX SCALE MATERIAL (VERTEX2|VERTEX1 VERTEX4|VERTEX3)
The Scale is not a word :P but a high byte/low byte combo. If the low byte
is zero, the high byte should be added to the orginal model scale AS A
SIGNED CHAR.
If the low byte is not zero (80h, might be other value???) the high byte is
a LOCAL VARIABLE number, and also should be added to the original model
scale. "Original model" is the PARENT it is drawn from, not the sub-object.
That should take care of the large light masts I see on your orbiter
stations :)

MATERIAL with local colour:
001A MATERIAL 00|NORMAL (?)
001A MATERIAL1 VARIABLE|00 MAT2 MAT3 MAT4 MAT5 MAT6 MAT7 MAT8
Every MODELINSTANCE has a "local material" word.  The command 001A sets this
word to its result. The scaled subobject also has a MATERIAL parameter, I
use it like this:
DrawModel_t l_drawmdl;  // create the model locally
l_drawmdl.local_color = MATERIAL;       // set its local color to the one in
the command
..
drawmodel (&l_drawmdl); // ..and use it there
It seems to work this way -- I haven't used textures but the colors _look_
okay...
On my web pages I say "The UNLIT bit. If set then shading should not be
applied", but that only seems true for flat colors. Textures should always
be shaded.

BEZIER: 001C MATERIAL ... lots of points ..
I found this by trial and error! Just kept on switching numbers until it
worked...
I really should update the web page for this, I think I have it right now in
my mesh viewer.
p1 = meshptr[4] // CONTROL 1
p3 = meshptr[5] // END
p0 = meshptr[6] // START
p2 = meshptr[7] // CONTROL 2
bezier (p0, p1, p2, p3);

The same is true for the curves in the polygon. This is copied straight out
of the mesh viewer (and I THINK it's okay there...).
// StartCurve: 02|xx ST|C1 C2|ED
where ST=Start, ED=End, C1,C2=Control. These are bytes (written down in word
pairs), so if 02|XX is your current byte position, the '02' is at pos[1], ST
is pos[3], C1 is pos[2], C2 is pos[5] and ED is pos[4].
// ContinueCurve: 08|C1 C2|ED
C1 is at pos[0], C2 at pos[3], and ED at pos[2]. The start point ST is the
last coordinate from a previous command.

Planet scales:
well... I don't know FOR SURE. There is a Scale2 in the models, and I think
it should be added to the Scale. The result should be used to draw the
model. I know the models get very large: Object #146:Supergiant star,
Scale=22 and Scale2=19, so that's 22+19 = 41 (in powers of 2: 10^12 times
larger!). The game doesn't actually do any calculations with these large
values, only comparisons.

Mirror vertexes (Object #263):
Vertex type 5 = Negative -- It works for me..?? See object 263 in the mesh
viewer. Press 'p' to see point numbers, it might help.

Rotations: ... i'll have to come back on those later...

best!
