No surprise  ... bits 0..2 mirror, 3..5 rotate around one of the axes (and 
special value 6 uses a pre-set rotation matrix). In my wireframe mesh viewer 
you can see some correct rotations, some bad... and the latest version draws 
some of the Radiation warning signs on the Panther upside down -- again! 


AND 38h negates rows per bit, AND 07h gives 5 additional rotations. 
Bits 20h negates the top row of your matrix, 10h the second row, and 08h the 
third row. 
01h to 05h rotate 90deg along the x, y, and z axes. I had some problems 
interpreting this until I found you have to do the negate first (if 
necessary), then the rotation. Value 06h is a special (arbitrary) rotation 
angle, and 07h seems unused (though I'm getting increasingly careful stating 
something is "unused" :) 
I still have problems with this rotation, though -- I'll try to update 
galaxy7.html a.s.a. I have a fully working wireframe ... 
At the mo' I don't even dare to *think* of planet code...
